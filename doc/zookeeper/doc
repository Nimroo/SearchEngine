download zookeeper 3.4.13 tar file from link below:
http://apache.mindstudios.com/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.13/zookeeper-3.4.13.tar.gz

after extracting go to conf/zoo.cfg and use following configs:

tickTime=2000
initLimit=10
syncLimit=5
dataDir=/root/data/zookeeper/
clientPort=2181
server.1=nimroo1:2888:3888
server.2=nimroo2:2888:3888
server.3=nimroo2:2889:3889

tickTime : the basic time unit in milliseconds used by ZooKeeper.

initLimit : timeouts ZooKeeper uses to limit the length of time the ZooKeeper servers in quorum have to connect to a leader.(based on tickTime)

syncLimit : limits how far out of date a server can be from a leader.(based on tickTime)

dataDir : the location to store the in-memory database snapshots and, unless specified otherwise, the transaction log of updates to the database.

clientPort : the port to listen for client connections.

server.x : list the servers that make up the ZooKeeper service.it shows server X ip and the ports it use for comunicating other zookeepers
   	   so they can find each other,in order to tell the zookeeper which server it is u should make a file named 'myid' in data directory that just have one
	   number in it which is the server number for that zookeeper.

if there are more than 1 zookeepers in one server u should give them different clientPort and dataDir,and also different ports for server(for example server 2 and 3).

use the following command in zookeepers path to start eachone:    bin/zkServer.sh start

you can see last configs beside this doc.
