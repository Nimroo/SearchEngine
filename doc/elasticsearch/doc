download elasticsearch 6.3.2 from link below:
https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-6.3.2.tar.gz

after downloading and extracting go to the config/elasticsearch.yml and set following configs:

cluster.name: nimroo

node.name: node-x

network.host: server ip address

http.port: 9200

discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["94.23.216.137", "94.23.203.156"]

discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2


explanation of configs 

cluster.name: name of cluster which must be exactly the same in every node,because they use it to find other node in their cluster.

node.name: name of the node which must be unique for every node.

network.host: bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6).

http.port: port for communicating.

discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: the ips that is searched for nodes in same cluster,if one node in the cluster is found then all of them will know eachother
                                  but its not bad to have all ips here(for a small cluster!)

discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: minimum number of nodes needed for cluster to choose a master and start working(for preventing split brain n/2 + 1 suggested).

for starting every node go to bin directory in elasticsearch folder and run "./elasticsearch" command.
